# PenTest-Example
### A demonstration walkthrough of a pen test process using HTB's Paper with some normal dead ends as an example.  

*Note* /etc/hosts set to "htb 
Basic scan of all ports 
```
nmap -p- 10.10.11.100
```

The preferred way to scan.  A fast scan of all ports then a deeper scan for services on the found ports  
```
ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.11.100 | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)
nmap -sC -sV -p$ports 10.10.11.100
nikto -h 10.10.11.100
```
Interesting Results (NMAP): Running OpenSSH 8.2p1 and Apache httpd 2.4.41 on Ubuntu  
Interesting Results (NIKTO):  OSVDB-3093: /db.php  

**DEAD END:**  Using Hydra to guess common username/passwords for SSH.  Trying a small set of default username and password combinations work more often in real world vs. simulations.  
```
echo 'root\nuser\nadmin\nadministrator\ndevelopment\ntest\napache\nbountyhunter' > usernames
echo 'password\nPassword\nPassw0rd\nPassw0rd!' > passwords
hydra -L usernames -P passwords -e nsr ssh://10.10.11.100 
```

**Decision (NMAP):** Software is relatively current, no standout CVEs that allow remote access, so we will move on.  
**Decision (NIKTO):** The OSVBD has been superseded by CVE.  Not much to work with except `php` is being used.
